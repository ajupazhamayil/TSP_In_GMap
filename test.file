FunctionCallback function = &sphere; it declares that fucntion is a variable of type Functionclalback.
FunctionCallback is a type, which declares function pointer which has return value of double and array[D] as parameter.
 
 This function is getting used for findting f[D]
 This F[D] is used to find the fitness value for fitness[numbrOfFoods] usin function 'function'

  for all solutions i (FoodNumbers) Do,
   select one solution among all the foodsources randomly
   select one particular position(param2change) in the food source randomly
   (Randomly selected solution must be different from the solution i)
    then solution[param2change]=Foods[i][param2change]+(Foods[i][param2change]-Foods[neighbour][param2change])*(r-0.5)*2;
    (where r is a random value)
   Make solution1(descrete) array using SPV1 call out of the solution we made just now
   find the fitness1 of the current solution
   if current solution is better than old solution (Fitness1[i]):
     Replace the current path in Foods1[i][] and update cost in fitness1[i]
   else 
     put trial[i] = trial[i]+1
